## Synopsis

Log files (.BIN)  generated by a Pixhawk running ArduPilot Firmware can be converted to comma separated files (.csv). This repository provides a means to replay these log files in Flight Gear, an open-source flight simulator, and allows displaying of important flight data while the 3D visulisation is running.

## GUI
The following is a preview of what this package does.

## Code Example

Navigate to the source directory of this repository in a terminal, and run

```python
python fgLauncher.py
```
to launch the Flight Gear instance. Once this is fully up and running, run the timeControl.py script in another terminal.

```python
python timeControl.py
```

## Motivation

Analysing flight logs to look for a certain behaviour can be hard, this software aims to reduce this difficulty by making it easier to pinpoint the time that this behaviour occurs.

## Installation

This requires that Flight Gear be installed, download it from here: http://www.flightgear.org/
If you are starting with .BIN files, then you will need a script called sdlog2_dump.py, written by Anton Babushkin. Download it to the root directory of the repo, from https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Tools/sdlog2/sdlog2_dump.py

You will also require an aircraft to operate in Flight Gear. Current the launcher is setup for the Rascal110. This can be downloaded from https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/Tools/autotest/aircraft. Save the 'aircraft' directory in the root folder, and rename it 'Aircraft'.

You will need an installation of Python 2.7. Other required packages are
* pymavlink
* numpy

These can be installed with

```python
pip install <package_name>
```
